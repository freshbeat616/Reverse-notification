A hilariously useless web app that sends you notifications when nobody else does! Features a 
dramatic bomb timer countdown in the final 10 seconds with beeping sounds, visual effects, and "detonation"
when your loneliness timer expires.

When you have no notification

YOU enable this App and there you go a notification
that you were desperate for!
